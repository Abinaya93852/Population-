Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Sample Dataset :-

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

To create a bar chart or histogram visualizing the population distribution from the dataset you provided, we'll need to first gather the data. The provided link is for the World Bank's total population data over time, so we can plot this as a time series or a distribution of populations across years.

Here's how you can approach this in Python using Matplotlib and Pandas:

Steps:
Install dependencies:

pip install matplotlib pandas
Download the data: You can either download it manually or use Python to fetch it from the World Bank API.

Code to generate the chart:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_html(url)[0]

# Check the first few rows of the data to understand its structure
print(data.head())

# Assuming the data is in columns "Year" and "Population"
# We can plot a bar chart (for categorical) or histogram (for continuous) based on this data

# For a bar chart visualizing population by year
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.bar(data['Year'], data['Population'], color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Population')
plt.title('Total Population Over Time')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Explanation:
Pandas is used to manipulate and read the dataset.
Matplotlib creates a bar chart where the x-axis represents years and the y-axis represents the population.
